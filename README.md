# Disclaimer
The code for the application itself was generated by the lead developers from the company that sent me this challenge. I do not own the rights to that code nor did I contribute 
to the code in anyway. I have updated this README file for the sole purpose of including only the details of the E2E testing. However the original README details can be found in the Dev_readme.md file.

# QA testing

This is a full stack QA Testing Challenge that was provided to me to facilitate QA testing for all 3 layers: UI, API, Database. 

All of the code within the 'testing' directory was added to the project from me. The automation frameworks I utilized were:

1. Selenium(Java) for the front end UI testing
2. Junit for BDD framework 
3. RestAssured for API testing
4. postgresql(JDBC) for the Database testing
